## Project Goals

The main goals of this project include:
- To predict T20 match winners using historical match data.
- To enhance the model's accuracy through effective feature engineering and algorithm selection.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to understand the dataset, identify trends, and visualize key relationships among variables.

### Feature Engineering
- Performed feature engineering on 20+ features, boosting model accuracy by 10% in predicting T20 match winners.

### Model Selection
- Evaluated and tested multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost, to determine the most effective machine learning model.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, resulting in a final model with an AUC of 0.84 and an F1 score of 0.78.

## Results

The project successfully enhanced prediction accuracy and provided insights into the factors influencing match outcomes. The final model's performance metrics demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting T20 match winners.
